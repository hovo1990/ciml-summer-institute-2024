1. Parallel concepts (2.2.)
    1) Need good justification for ACCESS for CPU and GPU to convince
    2)     2.2_parallel_computing_concepts/Parallel concepts CIML.pdf
    3) **High throughput jobs** is when running many small jobs that use one core or one gpu
    4) Threads and processes are both independent sequences of execution
    5) Being aware of threads and processses will help you understand how your code is utilizing the hardware and identify common problems.
    6) MPI is for parallelizing C, C++ and Fortran code, is the defacto standard.
    7) Horovod and NCCL for parallelizing deep learning application.
    8) MPI pretty low level between assembly and C
    9) Use appropriate MPI wrappers
    10) MPI is library, OpenMP is an interface
    11) OpenMP more readable than MPI
    12)MPICH and OpenMPI are just implemations for MPI
    13) GCC includes and implements OpenMP standard
    14) 1 process per core on MPI
    15)
